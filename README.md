# odin-recipes
This project is an recipes website using only HTML.
The deal is to gain proficiency in git, git commit messages and practicing website creation.
Important note : The content of my website is AI-generated . From the images down to every fullstop on the page. Now I didn't copy the code, that would be wrong. I just couldn't bear to write recipes of dishes I have never tasted or seen before. I don't think this should be a problem.
