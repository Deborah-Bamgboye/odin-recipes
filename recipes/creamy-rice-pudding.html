    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are few desserts as nostalgic and soothing as homemade Rice Pudding. This stovetop version transforms humble ingredients—rice, milk, and sugar—into a velvety, custard-like treat.</p>
    <p>It requires a little patience at the stove, but the result is far superior to store-bought cups. Infused with vanilla and dusted with cinnamon, this gluten-free dessert is versatile enough to be served warm on a cold winter night or chilled with fruit compote in the summer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Rice: ½ cup Arborio or short-grain white rice (uncooked). Short grain is essential for that creamy texture.</li>
        <li>The Liquid: 4 cups whole milk (divided).</li>
        <li>Sweetness: ⅓ cup white sugar (adjust to taste).</li>
        <li>Flavor: 1 tsp pure vanilla extract, ¼ tsp salt.</li>
        <li>Finishing: Ground cinnamon for dusting, optional raisins or butter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blanch the Rice (Optional): Rinse the rice briefly. Place rice in a saucepan with enough water to cover it. Bring to a boil, let cook for 2 minutes, then drain. (This step helps the rice absorb the milk better, but can be skipped for a quicker version).</li>
        <li>Simmer: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the rice, 3-5 cups of the milk, sugar, and salt. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook and Stir: Reduce heat to low to maintain a very gentle simmer. Cook for 40-50 minutes, stirring frequently (especially toward the end) to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Finish: Once the rice is tender and the mixture has thickened to a porridge consistency, remove from heat. Stir in the remaining ½ cup of milk and the vanilla extract. (It may look loose, but it will thicken significantly as it cools).</li>
        <li>Serve: Ladle into bowls. Dust with cinnamon. Enjoy warm, or press plastic wrap directly onto the surface and refrigerate to serve cold.</li>
    </ol>
