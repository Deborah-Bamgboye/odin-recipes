    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Classic Beef Stroganoff is the definition of comfort food. Originating in Russia, this dish has conquered the world with its luxurious, savory sauce made from beef broth, mustard, and sour cream.</p>
    <p>It looks and tastes elegant enough for a dinner party, but it comes together in under 30 minutes, making it perfect for a busy weeknight. The secret lies in searing the beef quickly to keep it tender and using plenty of mushrooms for that deep, earthy umami flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Beef: 1.5 lbs (700g) Sirloin or Ribeye steak, sliced into thin strips (against the grain).</li>
        <li>The Veg: 1 large onion (chopped), 2 cups Cremini or button mushrooms (sliced), 2 cloves garlic (minced).</li>
        <li>The Sauce: 1.5 cups beef broth, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp Dijon mustard.</li>
        <li>The Creaminess: ½ cup full-fat sour cream (room temperature).</li>
        <li>Serving: 12 oz wide egg noodles, fresh parsley for garnish.</li>
        <li>Staples: Salt, black pepper, olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sear the Beef: Season the beef strips generously with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over high heat, sear the beef in oil in batches until browned (about 1–2 minutes per side). Do not overcrowd the pan. Remove beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>Sauté Vegetables: Reduce heat to medium. Melt the butter in the same pan. Add onions and mushrooms. Sauté until the onions are soft and mushrooms are browned (about 5–7 minutes). Add garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Build the Gravy: Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir for 1 minute to cook off the raw flour taste. Slowly pour in the beef broth while stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Add Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard. Simmer for 3–5 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>Combine: Turn the heat down to low. Stir in the sour cream until smooth (Note: do not let the sauce boil once the cream is added, or it may curdle). Return the beef and its juices to the pan and warm through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Ladle generously over hot egg noodles and garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
