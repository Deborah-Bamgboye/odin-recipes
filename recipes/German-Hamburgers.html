    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Forget everything you know about the American burger bun—meet the Frikadelle (also known as Buletten or Fleischpflanzerl). These are traditional German pan-fried meat patties that are a staple in German households and beer gardens alike.</p>
    <p>Unlike a standard burger, Frikadellen use soaked bread and eggs in the mixture, resulting in a texture that is incredibly fluffy on the inside while maintaining a delicious crispy crust. They are traditionally served with spicy mustard, warm potato salad, or a crusty roll.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Meat: 1 lb (500g) Ground meat (a mix of 50/50 beef and pork is traditional for flavor and fat content).</li>
        <li>The Binder: 1 stale bread roll (or 2 slices of white bread) soaked in water or milk, plus 1 large egg.</li>
        <li>Flavor Base: 1 medium onion (very finely diced), 1 tbsp fresh parsley (chopped).</li>
        <li>Seasoning: 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp black pepper, 1 tsp paprika (sweet or spicy), 1 tsp mustard (German or Dijon), pinch of marjoram (optional).</li>
        <li>Frying: 2 tbsp oil or clarified butter (Buttterschmalz).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Bread: Soak the stale bread in water or milk for about 10 minutes until soft. Squeeze out all excess liquid tightly with your hands.<li>
        <li>Sauté Onions (Optional but Recommended): For a milder flavor, sauté the diced onions in a little butter until translucent and let them cool. If you prefer a sharper bite, you can use them raw.</li>
        <li>Mix: In a large bowl, combine the ground meat, squeezed bread, egg, onions, parsley, mustard, and spices. Use your hands to knead the mixture until well combined and slightly sticky.</li>
        <li>Shape: Wet your hands slightly (to prevent sticking) and form the mixture into 4–6 large, thick patties.</li>
        <li>Fry: Heat oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Fry the patties for about 4–5 minutes per side until they are dark golden brown and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve: Eat warm with mustard and potatoes, or cold on a sandwich the next day.</li>
